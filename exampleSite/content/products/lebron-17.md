The LeBron 17 also features an innovative, incredibly lightweight Knitposite upper for ultimate movement and flexibility.

### Pliable Protection

Merging the adaptive fit of Flyknit with the protective feel of Foamposite, the new Knitposite construction features a lightweight, sock-like upper, with a hard shell in key areas for fearless play.

 

### Creating the LeBron 17

For the LeBron 17, LeBron James challenged Nike designer Jason Petrie and his team to build a product that "creates force without fear". This directive led Petrie to design a shoe that uses Air to protect LeBron, while also delivering next-level quickness.
